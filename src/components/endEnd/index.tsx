      <h3>üìú Conclusion</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Through detailed visualizations, this project highlights San
          Francisco‚Äôs dynamic role as a cinematic setting, illustrating how the
          city‚Äôs neighborhoods and landmarks have both shaped‚Äîand been shaped
          by‚Äîfilm and television productions. While iconic sites like the Golden
          Gate Bridge remain timeless cinematic symbols, neighborhood-level
          trends reveal evolving patterns that reflect shifts in aesthetic
          preferences and production logistics over time. The well-known filming
          locations can serve as a unique selling point for productions,
          attracting audiences through familiar or picturesque settings. In
          turn, the visibility and reach of these films and shows promote the
          featured locations themselves‚Äîcreating a positive feedback loop
          between media exposure and urban recognition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project also expose contrasting storytelling strategies: some
          productions fully immerse viewers in the city‚Äôs urban fabric through
          extensive location usage, while others employ symbolic backdrops to
          convey meaning more economically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, genre-based analyses underscore San Francisco‚Äôs narrative
          versatility, showing how a wide range of genres‚Äîfrom romance and
          biography to thriller and mystery‚Äîcontinue to find expressive space in
          the city‚Äôs diverse environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, these patterns reveal more than media trends‚Äîthey trace
          how film and city continuously shape each other, blurring the line
          between fiction and place, and transforming San Francisco into both a
          storyteller and a story.

        <h3>üîÅ Feedback Incorporation</h3>
        <p>
          Several pieces of feedback helped me improve the project‚Äôs clarity and
          flow. One recurring suggestion was about scale and readability‚Äîfor
          example, the year labels on the heatmap were a bit cramped, and the
          IMDb rating chart showed a 0‚Äì9 axis even though IMDb scores go from 1
          to 10. I adjusted both of those: the heatmap now has better spacing
          for the years, and the rating chart reflects the full 1‚Äì10 scale so
          it‚Äôs easier to read and interpret.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another helpful comment pointed out that the line chart which shows
          the over time activities felt out of place between the neighborhood
          and location-based visuals. I ended up moving it so that all the
          spatial-focused charts are grouped together, which made the layout
          feel more cohesive. I also made sure that genre colors and
          neighborhood references stayed consistent across graphs, and I added a
          tooltip on the map to make it clear that the timeline runs from 1915
          to 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, a few feedback suggested making things more interactive, like
          filtering by year or neighborhood. While full filtering wasn‚Äôt
          possible due to tool limitations, I added selective interactivity to
          the heatmap so viewers can better explore patterns across time.
        </p>
        <h3>üåä Development Process</h3>
        <p>I followed a 5 weeks timeline to develop this project:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Week 1(3.16 - 3.23): Brainstormed the project theme and searched for
            relevant datasets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Week 2(3.23 - 3.30): Chosed the final dataset to be used for the
            project, and performed the initial data processing.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Week 3(3.30 - 4.6): Started working on the visualization, and
            performed the data processing by the development process.
          </li>
          <li>
            Week 4(4.6-4.13): Delivered the first version for peer feedback.
          </li>
          <li>
            Week 5(4.13-4.20): Incorporated peer feedback, and added write-up
            for the project.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
